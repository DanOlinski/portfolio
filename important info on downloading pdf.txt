-For some reason if I place a PDF inside the public folder then run "npm run deploy" the process will fail, because of the PDF file in the public folder

-To work around this run the deploy command without the pdf in the public folder. 
-Keep build folder open and ready to paste the PDF file
-As soon as the images folder dissapeares and appears again, paste the PDF file in the build folder
